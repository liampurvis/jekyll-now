Some information about me:

### The Short of It

I am a Data Scientist Specializing in Statistics and Machine Learning. Trained at UC Berkeley (undergraduate), currently applying to graduate school, I have a 9 month gap in between these two adventures where I am looking to work on something exciting.

### The Long of It

Originally from Upstate NY, in my childhood imaginings Data Science was the last place I would have imagined ending up.
